# Test_Project_Django_ORM

This is a simple Django web application with two views defined in the views.py file. The first view, index, renders an index.html template using the render function from Django shortcuts. The second view, about, renders an about.html template using the same render function.

In the urls.py file, two URL patterns are defined using the path function from Django urls. The first pattern is for the root URL ('') and maps to the index view. The second pattern is for the /about URL and maps to the about view.

Overall, this code sets up a basic Django application with two pages, an index page and an about page.
